<h2>About</h2>

<p>Welcome again to Draft Right! </p>
        <p>I'm Dilip Rout, a seasoned technical writer with a passion for breaking down complex ideas into clear, accessible content. <a href="https://www.draftright.in">Draft Right</a> was born out of my journey in technical writing and a desire to share what I’ve learned along the way.</p>

        <p>As I look back on my decade-long journey in technical writing, the transition from aerospace documentation to software documentation stands as a testament to the versatility and evolving nature of our profession.</p>
        <h2>The Early Days: Taking Flight in Aerospace</h2>
        <p>My technical writing journey began in 2013 at <b><a href="https://www.cyient.com/">Cyient Ltd</a></b>., where I worked as a <b>Design Engineer</b> focusing on <b>Technical Publications</b>. Fresh from my Aircraft Maintenance Engineering background from <b>Flytech Aviation Academy</b>, I found myself immersed in creating comprehensive end-user manuals and reference guides for complex aerospace systems.</p>
        <p>The aerospace industry taught me crucial foundational skills:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Attention to detail</b>: When documenting aircraft components, there's zero room for error</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Regulatory compliance</b>: Working with strict aviation standards and regulations</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Technical accuracy</b>: Converting complex engineering specifications into clear documentation</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Structured documentation</b>: Using Content Management Systems effectively</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The Transition Phase: Landing in Software</h2>
        <p>In late 2016, I made a pivotal career move to <b><a href="https://www.proxim.com/">Proxim Wireless</a></b> as a <b>Technical Writer</b>. This marked my entry into the software and hardware documentation realm. The transition wasn't without its challenges, but my aerospace background provided unexpected advantages:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The systematic approach to documentation I learned in aerospace translated well to software</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Experience with complex systems helped me grasp intricate software architectures</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The precision required in aerospace documentation proved valuable in API and technical documentation</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>At <b>Proxim</b>, I expanded my toolkit, collaborating with development engineers, quality teams, and product managers. This role bridged my transition, as it involved both hardware and software documentation.</p>
        <h2>Soaring in Software Documentation</h2>
        <p>The journey continued through <b><a href="https://www.progress.com/">Progress Software</a></b> and now at <b><a href="https://www.infiniteblue.com/">Infinite Blue (an Everbridge Company)</a></b>, where I've fully embraced the role of <b>Senior Information Developer</b>. The software industry brought new challenges and opportunities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Adapting to agile development methodologies</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Learning to document APIs and complex software systems</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Embracing tools like DITA/XML, HTML, and SGML</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Implementing single-sourcing and context-sensitive help systems</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Key Lessons from the Journey</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Technical writing principles are universal</b>: Whether documenting an aircraft component or an API, the core principles of clarity, accuracy, and user-focus remain constant.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Adaptability is crucial</b>: The willingness to learn new tools, technologies, and domains has been key to my growth.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Domain expertise is transferable</b>: My aerospace background provided a strong foundation in technical understanding and documentation structure.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Collaborative skills matter</b>: Both industries require strong collaboration with subject matter experts and various stakeholders.</p>
